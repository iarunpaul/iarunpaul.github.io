The container probes are among the basic best practices advised for k8s
cluster before going to production. It helps for deploying self probing and resilient services(restart) on Kubernetes. 							
            
The differnt categories under which we can put k8s container probes can
be broadly as follows:

- `readiness-probe`
- `liveness-probe`

The readiness probe determines when a container can receive
                  traffic.

he kubelet executes the checks and decides if the app can
                  receive traffic or not.

## Containers have Readiness probes

Please note that there's no default value for readiness and
                  liveness.
If you don't set the readiness probe, the kubelet assumes that
                  the app is ready to receive traffic as soon as the container
                  starts.\
If the container takes 2 minutes to start, all the requests to
                  it will fail for those 2 minutes.

Lets have a quick look at how we applied our config


{% highlight yaml %}
readinessProbe:
  failureThreshold: 3
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
  successThreshold: 1
  tcpSocket:
    port: 80
  timeoutSeconds: 1
{% endhighlight %}
